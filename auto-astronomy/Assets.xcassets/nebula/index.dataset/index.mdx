Nebulae are enormous clouds of dust and gas that act as a nurseries for new stars.

I have too many pictures of nebula to display (many of them the mediocre shots of a learner), but these are some of my favorite from different points in my journey as a photographer. Keep in mind that most of these shots collect 15+ hrs of data, often collected over multiple weeks. Enjoy :)
